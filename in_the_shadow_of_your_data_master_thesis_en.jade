      “Today marks 28 years since I submitted my original proposal for the world wide web. I imagined the web as 
      an open platform that would allow everyone, everywhere to share information, access opportunities and collaborate 
      across geographic and cultural boundaries. [...] But over the past 12 months, I’ve become increasingly worried about 
      three new trends, which I believe we must tackle in order for the web to fulfill its true potential as a tool which serves 
      all of humanity: we’ve lost control of our personal data, it’s too easy for misinformation to spread on the web 
      and political advertising online needs transparency and understanding.”

    p. <u> Foreward </u>
    p.
      Data are seen by many as the black gold of the 21st century. And because we are generating more and more of this, 
      there is a growing sense of euphoria. We believe that algorithms can relieve us of the burden of making many 
      complex decisions on our own, help us achieve a better understanding of our environment, or even predict the future². 
      “Big Data” is the buzzword that is synonymous for some people with the hope that more data will mean more knowledge, 
      transparency and a better economic prosperity. However, this must be balanced by a critical analysis of the effects and 
      consequences because, through the “white noise” generated by data masses, we can still be identified and followed against 
      our will³ by both web companies and States.
    
    p.
      You may not be aware but we are constantly and continuously surrounded by data. The wind speed can be considered as data, and so can your IP 
      address. Data are everywhere which means that from now on, we are evolving in a digital society entirely linked to Big Data and metadata issues. 
      Data are the conventional representation of a piece of information which can be analogue or digital and which can be automatically processed 
      too. Metadata on the other hand, represent a piece of information on another piece of information, where the Greek prefix indicates 
      self-referencing, “data regarding other data”. To make it simple, in the example of a digital picture, the picture itself is the data and when 
      it was taken (for instance the day or the time) is the metadata.
    p.
      When we are surfing on the web, metadata are everywhere all the time: through our clicks, searches, requests, browsing history; through 
      the time, the date of connexion; through our current or passed localisation. Acting like intangible tracks of our actions, some of them 
      are collected by the visited websites⁴. Those tracks left during our virtual paths are mostly and generally unintentional but they are 
      also generating spatial and temporal coordinates. Eventually, those invisible and intangible details enable us to be identified⁵ and 
      tracked without our knowledge and against our will⁶.
    
    p.
      Embodying the new black gold of the 21st century for the GAFA (Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple), the current dominant companies of the web, 
      we need to consider and ask ourselves how we can get back power on our data today, for tomorrow’s daily uses. Furthermore, I wanted 
      to focus on metadata, about those tracks and paths in the web space which are invisible, intangible and hard to understand although 
      they are at the center of the web economy⁷. 
    p. 
      As a designer, and regarding the currently tense situation linked to the threats for our private life with the tracking on the Internet 
      for instance, I do not want to stigmatize web users. On the contrary, I want them to be aware that they are leaving unintentional 
      tracks which can be used to harm them. This highlights something paradoxical here: although web users create and generate data, 
      they can not master them⁸. 
    p.
      Based on these observations regarding our current environment filled with security abuses, the following issue emerges: 
      How can the graphic designer help web users to become e-aware users of their own digital data and more precisely their own metadata?
    p.
      First, to answer this question, the neologism “e-aware users” means two specific things:<br> 
      - e-aware meaning that web users are “electronically aware” of the value of their metadata, thus they knows the threats that could harm them. <br>
      - users meaning that web users develop an active behaviour, by becoming real actors, agents of their metadata. This way, they can 
      understand who is trying to steal their metadata and what is more, they can control the safety of their metadata better.
    p.
      Because metadata enable the tracking phenomena, we will try to understand how the graphic designer can use them as a real eye-opener to generate 
      an alternative way to act on the web with a real activist involvement in order to strike a balance that will put a fair level of data 
      control back in the hands of people. To do so, I have foregrounded three different but traversal project intentions. First, I want to help 
      web users to become more active with their metadata, by giving them the opportunity to have more protection through some counterattacks 
      and life hacks.
    p.
      Then, I want to make their digital shadow and tracks more visible because they are still interlinked to some blurred concepts in people's 
      minds. By making them more tangible, I think it will be easier for people to understand better what metadata are, what they represent, and 
      how they can reveal some of our habits⁹.
    p.
      Finally, I want to develop a sensitive relationship between web users, data and the computer screen. This project intention is more like an 
      experimental one; I do not want to sacralize data, I just think this approach, perhaps more poetic, sensitive and eye-catching, will be better 
      understood by people and will catch people’s attention better than just hundred raw lines of 0 and 1 which can eventually frighten them. This project 
      may be considered as a utopia but I have decided to choose it because above all, something puzzled me: through our everyday digital uses how 
      can data be exchanged without our knowing regarding their amount or quality? And even if design can not reveal surveillance, as a graphic designer 
    p.
      I will be fully involved in the process. I will act as a hacker, using hacks and tweakings to bypass preexisting rules in order to develop 
      several strategies and tools for web users. At the same time I am advocating for a true private life online, my creative approach will be 
      developed through two meaningful notions: ethics and integrity. And because they enable a clearer, a fairer, and a more transparent signal, 
      those notions will help web users to start and to pursue by themselves their own activist commitment which is needed to counteract and to shortcircuit 
      the growing power of GAFA and States on our data.
    p.
      More than becoming e-aware users, web users will eventually become hacker users.
    p <u> I. Design intentions </u>
    p <u> I.1 Helping web users to become more active about their metadata </u>
    p.
      One of my project intentions is to trigger and enhance an active behaviour regarding our own metadata, because they are an extension 
      of ourselves. Indeed, they tell third-parties where we are, who we are with, the sites we have visited, our favorite topics of interest, 
      and so on. While a single data point is not always sensitive, the loss of large amounts of aggregated data can be dangerous¹⁰. <br>
      As our private life is an essential part of our individuality, in a world where everything has been digitized, I was first interested 
      in pre-existing tools, and more specifically their pros and cons. <br> 
      After analysing several awareness campaigns, I have highlighted the fact that these campaigns always condemn the actions of the youngest 
      especially with an anxiety-provoking communication [fig. 01]. Moreover, they convey a really negative view [fig. 02] on their behaviours 
      using shocking images, and they never try to provide some solutions or suggest alternative ways to act on the web. 
      From my point of view and as a concerned Digital Intuitive, those campaigns are useless and pointless because they only put the blame on us and make us 
      feel childish using condescending speeches.
    p.
      On the other hand, several solutions already exist and work well: self-hosting for emails and cloud, the use of alternatives to 
      de-google-ify the Internet such as Framasoft network’s initiative for a free, decentralized and ethical Internet or even more 
      extreme measures such as the use of Tor, a free software enabling anonymous communication. Those solutions may seem perfect but a 
      problem still exists: unless web users have an experienced web server administrator and know their way around, those solutions 
      are neither simple nor easily accessible. Their use is interlinked with some specific skills, and pre-existing awareness of those alternatives.
    p.
      As a result, I do not want to stigmatize or to judge people regarding their actions on the web, I just want to 
      provide them with easier tools than what already exists. In fact, I intend to facilitate web users’ access to different useful and graphic 
      tools that I will especially design for them.
    p.
      This way, web users will understand better how to manage their metadata and thus empower their behaviour. My challenge 
      here will be first to help them to get back power and to alleviate the negative effects of this paradoxical situation: although we do 
      not know our web browser well enough, we are all using this daily tool which keeps increasing its knowledge about us. 
      In a second time, my aim will be to maintain web users’ commitment through a playful, civic and voluntary process. It will be 
      necessary to highlight all the benefits of users’ actions and this can be an opportunity for the graphic designer to think about 
      devices that create a reward or give a feedback which means something for them.
    p. 
      As a conclusion, helping web users to become more active regarding their metadata will happen in three ways: by 
      putting web users at the center of the process, by creating devices which allow them to directly and easily get back 
      power on their data and finally, by designing experiences which successfully awake and generate interest for their personal 
      data and what is at stake with them.
      
    p <u> I.2 Making the digital shadow and tracks more tangible </u>
    p.
      This intention is particularly a graphic research of the sensory transcription of metadata. Aiming to visually 
      transcribe data collection and its influence on our digital shadow, I want to make the two of them more tangible. As 
      a graphic designer, I will be a sort of translator who will give sense to something too complex which is not visible or meaningful 
      for most people.
    p.
      Actually, I will not be an imitator but an interpreter, and the challenge here will be to visually transcribe abstract notions, 
      related to our virtual exchanges and paths. By revealing them, I still do not want to frighten web users; this is why interactive or 
      playful experiences may seem relevant because of the need for a cultural and educational mediation needed that I can provide.
    p.
      Like <em>Click</em> [fig. 03], the website created by the Amsterdam based interactive design studio Moniker which reveals browser events 
      that monitor our online behaviour, I can demonstrate the amount of behavioural data that are collected today through several 
      trackers i.e. web cookies¹¹ and browser fingerprinting¹². By using an ironic or cynical tone as Moniker did but playing more 
      with typefaces, interactivity and the readability of information, my potential project would be less frightening for web users.
    p.
      On the other hand, I can also develop a more experimental approach, which will question the web space as a real space with 
      interactions, tracks and continuous information flows. By creating a sort of Internet topography of our paths like a video 
      game map, I will be able to make interactions more visible and significant, make the virtual links between the visited websites 
      more tangible but also question several notions such as real time and re-actualization which are deeply interwoven with the web.
    p.
      The website <em>I-Remember</em> [fig. 04], created by CLM BBDO, was based on this approach and concept; it represents 
      something intangible, here a biological memory affected by Alzheimer's disease and the disappearance of its memories. The website 
      is quite abstract and non-physical, this way the web user can virtually travel through a dark and complex universe only revealed by 
      several shiny points representing memories.
    p.
      This metaphor of a starry sky forces us to be immersed while we wander through the vestiges of past experiences which have been 
      posted on the website. Interactivity allows us to roam through all those data and to discover them alternatively and provides a 
      better understanding too, thanks to a graphic, phantasmagoric and truly immersive vocabulary.
    p. 
      With this kind of interactive experience, surprise and imagination can stimulate the interest of web users in other ways than 
      just a simple presentation of texts or pictures. 
    
    p <u> I.3 Developing a sensitive relationship between humans, data and the computer screen </u>
    p.
      Reconsidering the human place in the interaction with the device is the first goal of this intention, because 
      it seems necessary to learn how users interact with the digital world in general before imagining new experiences of and 
      with their digital data. I want to create a more “human”, a more welcoming and caring experience in the web space and at the 
      same time, I want to go further than just a simple data visualization which only allows a direct confrontation. 
    p.
      In my opinion, not only can screens be considered as boundaries because of the current develop-ment of new technologies such as virtual 
      reality or augmented reality, but they are also an open window on another world – a virtual one – but as real as our physical and 
      “in-real-life” world. We may just need to introduce more senses and emotions in this digital world by generating an environment that is 
      fully compatible with our emotions and far from being frightening. I think about a poetic and contemplative abstract universe where web 
      users could “play” with their own metadata by rediscovering them in a different way, with a new interaction, using sound or even touch. The 
      project <em>Reflexions</em> [fig. 05], created by Dpt., a Montreal based interactive creative studio, uses precisely this sensitive approach. 
      This interactive installation and mirror of the digital world represents an intelligent digital system that, like humans, uses 
      sensorial data to adapt itself to its surrounding. The subtle graphics and animations invite users to get closer to the projection 
      and, as they approach, their reflection on screen fades in as if passing through a veil into the digital realm. With 
      the same idea of creating a new interaction, their project <em>CLOUDS</em> [fig. 06], an interactive, generative documentary that allows 
      the viewer to explore different perspectives on the intersection of code and culture, was available on two platforms: first, an interactive 
      installation across several screens where viewers use gestures to interact with a Kinect sensor and navigate the experience and a second, 
      for individual viewing in virtual reality using the Oculus Rift, immersing users into the film.
    p.
      Furthermore, I think anticipation and imagination combined with technology can bring new experiences for users. This intention may be more 
      considered as a prospective one. I will try to anticipate how graphic design could imagine tomorrow’s lack of private life with a true critical 
      process. Moreover, this critical approach is currently developed by an activist graphic design studio named Metahaven through a theoretical 
      research that was exhibited in Berlin, in 2014. Named “Black Transparency: The right to know in the age of mass surveillance” [fig. 07], it 
      exhibited several visual projects such as drawings, videos, gifs, interviews with activists in order to highlight two phenomena: first of all, 
      the ambiguity and contradiction of the production and second the use of personal data. Nevertheless, the main issue of this exhibition was the 
      fact that it was quite too “intellectual” and not easily understandable for most people because of the graphism and the creative process.
    p <u> II. Design projects </u>
    p.
      These three intentions are transversal and were the basis for my design work. Thanks to them, I was finally able to think about and select several 
      project ideas that I could design to answer my main issue. From now on, I am working on four different projects: <br>
      - hack/olyte, a web plugin and user interface measuring the impact of trackers on our online browsing in real time, <br>
      - hack/tivity, a video game based on our browsing history (part of our online activity) allowing a new interaction with our data, <br>
      - hack/tion, a co-op board game denouncing the monopoly of Google on our data & where the players fight together against this villain, <br>
      - hack/cess, an interactive experience demonstrating the tracking on public wifi.
      
    p <u> II.1 hack:olyte </u>
    p.
      A device measuring the impact of trackers used by the visited websites on our online activity. 
    p. 
      This idea emerged from a meeting with Olivier Desbiey who works at the CNIL¹³. Two years ago, he and other co-workers developed an 
      open-source tool which is named Cookieviz, a real time tracking data visualization while we are surfing on the web. This tool is currently 
      used to measure the impact of cookies but is still quite frightening and its user interface is not really welcoming or friendly. The idea 
      here is to design a new interface and then, to add a real time graphic plugin which indicates where (and when) data are collected, 
      meanwhile our online navigation.
    p.
      First, I was interested in using saturated colours in order to promote a reassuring and a more poetic vocabulary when data are 
      collected; however, I realized that it was maybe too naive or childish, and that it did not fit the fact that I wanted web users to be aware 
      of the reality of the environment in which they navigate.
    p.
      That is why I decided to pay more attention to glitch effects and to computer bugs’ aesthetic, using several textures, 
      transparencies and grainy masses determined by several parameters related to the data which are collected. The thing is 
      that the web interface is currently too experimental and it is finally hard to understand or to read any information [fig.&#8239;08].
    p.
      I am therefore reconsidering this interface in order to create a more pragmatic one¹⁴, to show the links between the websites we 
      visited and third-websites which are collecting all data on us. On the contrary, my plugin will be more experimental and will act as a 
      living and growing organism: when lots of data are collected, it will be impacted and, for example, the more data are collected, 
      the faster it moves. This is one of the reasons why this plugin is not square, but looks like an irregular circle with an organic 
      shape [fig.&#8239;9].
      
    p <u> II.2 hack:tivity </u>
    p.
      In a second time, I am currently developing a video game based on our online activity, enabling a new interaction with data from 
      our browsing history. It actually builds itself from the tracks we leave when we are doing some requests on Google with our Google account.
    p. 
      There is a precise temporality: first, web users need to go on the web and do some searches during the day. Then, every evening or every 
      week for instance, the video game acts as a reminder: the data collected from their browsing history are put into a text file, and 
      loaded into Processing to be graphically and visually transcribed. Web users/players can then interact with their tracks in a 
      different and unsual way from the list of their browsing searches [fig. 10].
    p.
      In order to create more than just a contemplative game, I have decided to add a challenge: by bouncing onto their tracks, 
      web users can (try to) delete them for about 1 minute. I want web users to be at the center of this awareness process and 
      to do so, I have decided that their character will be impacted during their experience: the more searches, the harder for the 
      player it is to move, or the more recurring the search is, the more space it takes...
      
    p.
      Through this device, I am in fact interested in the graphic treatment or representation of tracks which have been deleted 
      and those which have not. I am also questioning the notion of ruins on the web, the notion of an e-ghost 
      town and moreover, data retention. Thus, I led several kinds of experimentations on these notions, developing the idea of a 
      dual spatial reading [fig. 11].
    
    p <u> II.3 hack:tion </u>
    p.
      hack/tion is actually a co-op board game denouncing Google's monopoly on our data, and where the players fight together against this new “villain”.
    p. 
      From now on, I just led a graphic watch but for this concept I contemplate hybridizing the digital dimension with a more tangible one, 
      having a mix of interface and personal data with paper support which has a real materiality [fig. 12].
    p.
      In order to report the several mechanisms of surveillance that are impossible to disclose while online, the board game here will help the 
      players to conceptualize better those non-physical but harmful and damaging phenomena. I think that it will be more intuitive to play with 
      some physical and tangible supports even if the players can animate or interact with those supports with augmented reality [fig. 13].
      
    p.
      For this project, I aim to use simple tools or poor material because I would like to set up a device which eventually allows its 
      fabrication by users themselves. As well as the rest of my previous devices, I want to design this project as free as open because 
      all information should be free, as it matters to the hacker culture and its ethics.
      
    
    p <u> II.4 hack:cess </u>
    p.
      My last design project is more an interactive experience demonstrating the tracking on public wifi in airports. The idea here is to 
      reveal the hidden and invisible exchanges which are not secured on a public network, between a connected device 
      (a smartphone, a laptop, and so on) and a wifi access point. Using some hacks on this network and thanks to an engineer friend, 
      I am now able to easily pick packets sent on it and to retrieve the header of this packet which is not encrypted. Thanks to this header, 
      I know the IP address of the connected device, its MAC address, but also which device sends a request to which website 
      (without knowing what web users do on it).
    p. 
      I am conscious that this can be considered as a really terrifying and frightening project. But, by creating an unexpected and playful 
      experience using an existing advertising panel which can broadcast video content, I want to catch people’s attention when they are 
      bored or waiting for their flights.
    p.
      First of all, I want to create a sort of interface that will tell them that this is an experience when they connect to the access 
      point dedicated to the experience, and that they can start to navigate on the web with a protected connexion. Then, as soon as they connect, 
      a first message will appear on the panel such as “hello”, “hi”, or “bonjour” in French; this message will be picked randomly in a 
      dedicated database. All the future actions of people who will be connected, will be associated with a name, randomly picked too but 
      different for all the users so their actions can be identified and related to each users without revealing their true name 
      (which I can not find anyway) [fig. 14].
      
    p.
      Then, as I can identity hundreds of requests, I have decided to select several of them, linked to some specific uses on a public network: <br>
      - using the most common social network apps (Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, Instagram, Youtube) <br>
      - using the weather app (often connected to The Weather Channel), <br>
      - surfing on the web (Google, but also the most common news websites such as Le Monde, The New York Times, The Guardian, and so on) <br>
      - and finally, receiving new emails. <br>
    p.
      Afterwards, those uses are then automatically linked to some random and senseless phrases such as “trying to connect to Facebook”, 
      “refreshing my mails via 13 Google unknown servors”, ... [fig. 15]
    p.
      Those absurd phrases gathered together create a foolish dialogue that people can print thanks to a thermal printer next to 
      the panel. And at the end of the printed ticket, they will find a tutorial that will help them to protect themselves and their 
      data on a public network. They will also find more institutional information related to the CNIL or La Quadrature du Net, to promote 
      their actions on our data protection.
