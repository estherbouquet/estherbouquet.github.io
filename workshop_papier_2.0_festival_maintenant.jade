  h1 WORKSHOP PAPIER 2.0 â€” Ne nous froissons pas !

block project_description
  p.
    I took part in the creative workshop about augmented paper, led by Maintenant Festival, in Rennes. <br>
    After 48 hours, we created an interactive experience enabling a new experience of touch. Each visitor was invited to manipulate 
    a sheet of paper (scrunching it, scratching it, folding it, rolling it, stroking it, ...) creating a unique lighting reaction.
    Each one of those interactions were then graphically translated and saved, generating a collection of the individual experiences. 
    
  p You can see the project at 2'43 and 4'23.
