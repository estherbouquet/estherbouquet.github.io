        h1 Hello!
        p. 
          After a two-year vocational degree in space design at Olivier de Serres, I have graduated a multidisciplinary master degree with highest honour, 
          studying graphic design in Rennes. I worked for a year on my diploma project entitled “In the shadow of your data” focusing on this main issue:
          How can the graphic designer help web users to become e-aware users of their own digital data? I have created several devices which allow people 
          to know more about their data being collected and how to manage them easier in order to limit the collect.
        p.
          I am now pursuing my education in Saint-Etienne 
          Higher School of Art and Design, still in graphic design but more specifically in contemporary digital practices. I am questionning the issues and stakes
          linked to a design practice generated by algorithms and programming languages.
          I am also looking for an internship or a work opportunity from July to September 2018.
        p.
          I am really interested in art history and design theory, whose are a real part of my creative process.
          I also like mixing borders of graphic and space design through interdisciplinary projects, interactive installations, or wayfinding. 
          I enjoy exhibition scenography, the event quality of spaces but also digital and interactive medias.
        p.
          Always on the lookout for graphic and space design news, I took part in several workshops where I fisrt discovered
          interactive light experimentation and then various techniques, various practices such as typography or programming languages.
