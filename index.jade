          Hello, I am Esther Bouquet. <br><br>
          I am a graphic and space designer, <br>
          I am a designer of experiences.<br><br>
          After a two-year vocational degree <br> in space design at Olivier de Serres, <br> I have graduated a multidisciplinary master degree with highest honour, studying graphic design. <br><br>
          I am interested in art history and design theory. I like mixing borders between space and graphic design through interactive installations, exhibition scenography, and multidisciplinary projects. <br><br>
